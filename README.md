# sandwich_maker

### A simple script implementing PyInputPlus to simulate a sandwich being made and creating a running total price

The script uses either inputMenu() or inputYesNo for the most part to create the 'sandwich' through various options. At each step it returns the running total in pounds and uses a dictionary to check the price of each option.
